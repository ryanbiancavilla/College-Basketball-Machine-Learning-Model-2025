** NOTES ABOUT THE CODE **

- The target column means if the team won their next game, 1 for a yes, 0 for a no, 2 for a they have not had a next game yet.

- "opp_" is feature engineering to concatenate the opponents stats, creating defensive metrics for each given team.

- All stats were normalized and scaled to league average, excluding metadata.

- Resorted and reindexed data frame to go by game data rather than the original index by game ID.

- added 5 game rolling average for each team, regression somehow got worse.

- To predict future games, we will have to map and index the teams next matchup where there is a 2 for the target

- LTSM NN will be plug and play with the ridge regression.
